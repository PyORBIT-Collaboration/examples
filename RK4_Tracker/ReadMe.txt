The 3D lattice tracking - TEAPOT vs. 3D tracking benchmark:

rk_tracker_benchmark_for_3d_lattice_v0.py - tracking the whole bunch.
                       The lattice has only quads. Kickers' fields
                       are zero.

rk_tracker_benchmark_for_3d_lattice_v1.py - tracking two particles only
                       The lattice has only quads. Kickers' fields
                       are zero.

rk_tracker_benchmark_for_3d_lattice_v2.py - tracking the whole bunch.
                       The lattice has only quads. Kickers' fields
                       are not zero.

rk_tracker_benchmark_for_3d_lattice_v3.py - tracking two particles only
                       The lattice has only quads. Kickers' fields
                       are not zero.
